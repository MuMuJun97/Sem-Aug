# Sem-Aug
This is the code for "Sem-Aug: Improving Camera-LiDAR Feature Fusion with Semantic Augmentation for 3D Vehicle Detection". Our code and data is coming soon.


- The code implementation of our Sem-Aug is mainly based on the [NVIDIA Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/semantic-segmentation), [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) and [CIA-SSD](https://github.com/Vegeta2020/CIA-SSD). Thanks for their impressive work! ! !
